Next.js Data Fetching Demo

This project demonstrates the use of server-side and client-side data fetching in a Next.js application. By leveraging the power of Next.js and Prisma, it showcases how to efficiently fetch data from a database and render it on the web page. The project includes examples of fetching data both on the server side using getServerSideProps and on the client side using React hooks and Axios. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of data management in modern web development, making it an excellent resource for developers looking to enhance their Next.js applications.
